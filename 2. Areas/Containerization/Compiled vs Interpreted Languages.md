**Compiled Languages**
- A **compiled language** is translated into machine code **before execution**, during a separate **build step**. The result is a standalone binary that can run directly on the system without needing the original source code.
- The compiler translates the source code into machine code that is understandable by computers.

***Pros***
- **Private Code**: You only have to provide an executable in machine code to anyone that wants to run your program. You do not have to send the source code to anyone
- **Faster**: Once you have the executable you do not have to wait for any code to be translated into machine code.  The executable is also optimised for the CPU and OS you're on. 
***Cons***
- **Not Cross Platform**: If you have a Windows executable you cannot run it on Mac or Linux. 
- **Compile Time**: The compile time is lengthy. 

**Interpreted Languages**
- A programming language can be **interpreted**. This the code is read and executed **line by line** on the fly, with each instruction being **translated into machine code at runtime**.
- The interpreter translates the source code into machine code that is understandable by computers 

***Pros***
- **Portable**: An interpreted language is portable since we're not sending machine code over, we are sending source code and the machine that's running the code is responsible for getting it into a format it can understand 
***Cons***
- Every machine that runs your code needs an interpreter running on it. 
- Interpreted languages have to be interpreted every time you run them. 


**Hybrid Languages**
- Hybrid programming languages take the speed of compiled languages and the portability of an interpreted language.
