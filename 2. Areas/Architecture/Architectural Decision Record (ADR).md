- Architectural decision records help you document and communicate important process and architecture decisions in your engineering projects. 
- Each ADR should describe the architectural decision, it's context and consequences
- An ADR should be created for every architecturally significant decision impacting a software project or product. For example [Richards and Ford 2000](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/resources.html]): 
	- **Structure**: For example, patterns such as microservices 
	- **Non functional requirements**: security, high availabiilty , fault tolerance 
	- **Dependencies**: Coupling of components 
	- **Interfaces**: APIs and published contracts 
	- **Construction Techniques**: (libraries, frameworks, tools and processes)

**Example ADR**

**Title**

This decision defines the software development lifecycle approach for ABC application development.

**Status**

Accepted

**Date**

2022-03-11

**Context**

ABC application is a packaged solution, which will be deployed to the customer's environment by using a deployment package. We need to have a development process that will enable us to have a controllable feature, hotfix, and release pipeline.

**Decision**

We use an adapted version of the [GitFlow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to develop ABC application.

For simplicity, we will not be using the `hotfix/*` and `release/*` branches, because ABC application will be packaged instead of being deployed to a specific environment. For this reason, there is no need for additional complexity that might prevent us from reacting quickly to fix bugs in production releases, or testing releases in a separate environment.

The following is the agreed branching strategy:

- Each repository must have a protected `main` branch that will be used to tag releases.
    
- Each repository must have a protected `develop` branch for all ongoing development work.
    

**Consequences**

Positive:

- Adapted GitFlow process will enable us to control release versioning of the ABC application.
    

Negative:

- GitFlow is more complicated than trunk-based development or GitHub flow and has more overhead.
    

**Compliance**

- The `main` and `develop` branches in each repository must be marked as `Protected`.
    
- Changes to the `main` and `develop` branches must be propagated by using merge requests.
    
- At least one approval is required for every merge request.
