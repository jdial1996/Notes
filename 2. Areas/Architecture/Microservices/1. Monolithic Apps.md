- Before microservices,  the standard way of deploying applications was with a monolithic architecture.  This means that the code for all components of an application were treated as a **single unit**.
	- For example, if we have an online shopping app, all of it's componentds (user authentication, shopping cart, product catalog, sales campaigns, notifiations, payments etc.) would all coexist together in **ONE CODEBASE** as part of **ONE MONOLITHIC APPLICATION**
- Everything is developed, deployed and scale as a single unit, which means the application must be written in 1 language with 1 tech stack and a single runtime. 
- If you have different teams working on different parts of the monolith, they will need to coordinate to make sure they don't impact each others work:

If developers change code for the payment functionality, the whole application will need to be rebuilt and deployed as 1 package.  **You cannot just update and deploy only the payment code changes separately**

**Challenges of Monolithic Applications**
- This was the standard way of deploying applications but as applications grow in size and complexity numerous challenge arose: 

1. Coordination between teams became more difficutl as code was much bigger and different parts of the application were more tangled in each other 
2. If you had a spike on shopping carts on holiday dates and you want to scale onlyt hat part of the app , you can't do it.
	1. You would need to scale the whole app which leads to **HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN SCALING UP OR DOWN**

3. Release process takes longer 
	1. On every change the entire app needs to be tested
	2. On every change the entire app need to be rebuilt and redeployed. 
	3. A bug in any module can bring down the entire app (blast radius)
