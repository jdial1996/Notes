- With microservices an application is **broken down into multiple smaller applications**
- **To break down an application we need to decide**
	- **What code goes where?** 
		- ***The best practice is to break down the app into components based on business functionalities and not technical functionalities: eg. shopping carts, checkout, product catalog etc***
	- **How many services do we create?** 
	- **How big/small should the microservices be?** 
	- **How do the microservices communicate?** 

**The Microservices Criteria**
- Break down applications into services based on business functionality 
- **Separation of concerns**: Have 1 service for 1 specific job
	- eg. Don't have a microservice responsible for both checkout and shopping carts, have separate microservices for each one. 
- **Loose Coupling**
	- Microservices should be self contained and independent of each other, so they should be **developed, deployed and scaled** independently without any tight dependencies on other services (even though they are part of the same application).
	- Therefore each microservice will have it's own version.  If we release one service, we don't have to release another. 




**Downsides of Microservices**
	When you break down an aplpication into several smalelr components, there are challenges: 
		- Configuring communication between microservices
		- More difficult to monitor multiple instances of each services distribued across servers
