- Microservices need to communicate with each other but how?: 

1. **Communication with API calls** (**Synchronous**)
	1. Each servie has an endpoint on which it accetps requests from other services.  Services can talk to each other by sending each other HTTP reqeuests on this endpoint 
2. **Communication via Message Brokers** (**Asynchronous**)
	1. Services send message to an intermediary emssage service such as RabbitMQ or SQS
	2. The message broker forwards the message to the respective service

3. **Communication via a Service Mesh (popular with k8s)**
	1. With a service mesh you have a helper service which takes over the complete communication logic.  This means you do not have to code the logic into the microservice
