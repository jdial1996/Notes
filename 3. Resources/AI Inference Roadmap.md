## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Model Serving & Deployment (Weeks 1‚Äì3)

- [ ] **Serve a ML model as an API (FastAPI/Flask)**  
  _Tools:_ FastAPI, Flask  
  _Goal:_ Serve a basic model via REST API.

- [ ] **Learn and deploy with BentoML or TorchServe**  
  _Tools:_ BentoML, TorchServe  
  _Goal:_ Package and serve a model using a model server.

- [ ] **Containerize model API with Docker**  
  _Tools:_ Docker  
  _Goal:_ Create a reusable Docker image of your model API.

- [ ] **Deploy to Kubernetes (EKS or Minikube)**  
  _Tools:_ Kubernetes, Helm  
  _Goal:_ Run model on a scalable cluster.

- [ ] **Add autoscaling and load balancing to model service**  
  _Tools:_ HPA, AWS ALB  
  _Goal:_ Enable auto-scaling and traffic routing.

## üîÅ Phase 2: Automate, Monitor, and Optimize (Weeks 4‚Äì6)

- [ ] **Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for model deployments**  
  _Tools:_ GitHub Actions  
  _Goal:_ Push to Git = deploy to prod.

- [ ] **Enable GPU scaling using Karpenter and AWS GPU nodes**  
  _Tools:_ AWS EC2, Karpenter  
  _Goal:_ Automatically scale GPU infra.

- [ ] **Add observability: latency, errors, and resource metrics**  
  _Tools:_ Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog  
  _Goal:_ Monitor inference behavior in real-time.

- [ ] **Use Kubecost and spot instances to optimize cost**  
  _Tools:_ Kubecost, AWS Spot Advisor  
  _Goal:_ Reduce compute costs without breaking inference.

- [ ] **Set up GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux (optional)**  
  _Tools:_ ArgoCD, Flux  
  _Goal:_ Manage deployments declaratively from Git.

## üöÄ Phase 3: Go Pro ‚Äî Build Templates & Client-Ready Assets (Weeks 7‚Äì8+)

- [ ] **Build reusable Terraform + Helm boilerplate for model infra**  
  _Tools:_ Terraform, Helm  
  _Goal:_ Reuse infra setup for every new project.

- [ ] **Publish 2‚Äì3 example projects on GitHub**  
  _Tools:_ GitHub  
  _Goal:_ Build credibility + show off your skills.

- [ ] **Create a landing page for your model infra service**  
  _Tools:_ Carrd, Notion, Webflow  
  _Goal:_ Link to your offer in emails, socials, and outreach.

- [ ] **Build a lead list of target AI startups**  
  _Tools:_ Sales Navigator, Crunchbase  
  _Goal:_ Begin outbound sales or freelancing outreach.

- [ ] **Write and publish a technical case study on model infra**  
  _Tools:_ Notion, Markdown  
  _Goal:_ Demonstrate how you solve real problems.
